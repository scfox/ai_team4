# Feature Specification: GitAI Teams - Multi-Agent GitHub Automation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-read-the-documents`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Read the documents under project-spec, starting with the PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md and HANDOFF.md files. These are the results of an earlier prototype / iteration on this idea, and includes lessons learned and some simplification assumptions. Ask for any clarifications required."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse @gitaiteams mention in GitHub issue
   � If no mention: SKIP (no action taken)
2. Determine if task requires parallelization
   � Analyze task for independent subtasks
3. For single tasks:
   � Execute directly and respond to issue
4. For parallel tasks:
   � Spawn child agents (max depth 1 level)
   � Wait for child PR completions
   � Combine results and respond
5. Post unified response to original issue
   � Format results appropriately
6. Run Review Checklist
   � If workflow count mismatch: ERROR "Unexpected workflow behavior"
   � If recursion detected: ERROR "Children cannot spawn grandchildren"
8. Return: SUCCESS (task completed and posted to issue)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A GitHub user wants to trigger AI agents to complete tasks by mentioning @gitaiteams in GitHub issues (when created) or issue comments. The system should automatically determine whether to handle the task directly or spawn parallel agents for efficiency, then post a comprehensive response back to the issue.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub issue with a code review request, **When** user mentions @gitaiteams with a single task, **Then** system executes the task directly and posts review suggestions to the issue
2. **Given** a GitHub issue requesting framework comparison, **When** user mentions @gitaiteams with parallelizable tasks, **Then** system spawns child agents to research in parallel and posts a unified comparison table
3. **Given** a child agent is running, **When** the child attempts to spawn another agent, **Then** system prevents recursion and reports error
4. **Given** multiple child agents complete their tasks, **When** all results are ready, **Then** parent agent combines results and posts comprehensive response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when @gitaiteams is mentioned without a clear task? Respond with "Not sure what you are asking me to do here" and any contextually relevent questions.
- How does system handle child agent failures? Continue on child failures if possible (multiple children) and report status.
- What is the maximum number of parallel child agents allowed? 5
- How long should system wait for child agents before timeout? 8 minutes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST respond to @gitaiteams mentions in GitHub issues (on creation) and issue comments
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically determine if tasks can be parallelized
- **FR-003**: System MUST spawn child agents for parallelizable subtasks (maximum 1 level deep)
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent recursive agent spawning (children cannot have children)
- **FR-005**: System MUST combine results from all child agents into unified response
- **FR-006**: System MUST post final response as comment on original GitHub issue
- **FR-007**: System MUST complete single-task responses within 5 minutes
- **FR-008**: System MUST complete parallel-task responses within 10 minutes
- **FR-009**: System MUST use stateless architecture (derive all state from git/GitHub)
- **FR-010**: System MUST follow branch naming convention: issue-N for root, issue-N-child-M for children
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle 5 concurrent child agents
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide status updates during long-running tasks at least every 5 minutes

### Key Entities
- **GitHub Issue**: Represents the user's request, contains the @gitaiteams mention and task description (in issue body or comments)
- **Root Agent**: Primary agent triggered by @gitaiteams mention in issue or comment, can spawn child agents
- **Child Agent**: Secondary agent spawned by root for parallel task execution, cannot spawn additional agents
- **Task Result**: Output from agent execution, can be code review, research findings, or analysis
- **Combined Response**: Unified result merging all child agent outputs for presentation to user

## Clarifications Needed

Based on the project specifications reviewed, the following aspects require clarification:

1. **Error Handling**: What should happen when @gitaiteams is mentioned without a clear task?
2. **Failure Recovery**: How should the parent agent handle child agent failures - continue with partial results or fail entirely?
3. **Resource Limits**: What is the maximum number of parallel child agents that can be spawned?
4. **Timeouts**: What are the specific timeout durations for child agents and overall task completion?
5. **Status Updates**: Should the system post intermediate status comments during execution, and if so, at what frequency?
6. **Authentication**: Are there any specific user permissions required to trigger @gitaiteams? Only access to be able to create an issue.
7. **Rate Limiting**: Are there any rate limits on how frequently @gitaiteams can be triggered per user/repository? Imposed by Github based on account.
8. **Result Size**: What are the limits on response size when posting back to GitHub issues? Will have to research

The specification aligns with the simplified approach outlined in HANDOFF.md, focusing on the two core examples (single-task and parallel-task) while maintaining the key constraint of no recursive spawning.
