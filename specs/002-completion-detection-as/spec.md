# Feature Specification: Child Agent Completion Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `002-completion-detection-as`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "completion-detection as documented here: '/Users/sfox/Local/src/fox/ai/ai_team4/specs/completion-002.md'"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Input references external spec document
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Parent agents, Child agents, Claude analyzer
   ’ Actions: Spawn children, report status, count completions, analyze results
   ’ Data: Issue comments, PR numbers, status markers
   ’ Constraints: All children must report before analysis
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No major clarifications needed - spec is comprehensive
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: spawn ’ work ’ report ’ analyze ’ finalize
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement derived from spec document
   ’ All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Issues, Comments, Child Agents, Pull Requests
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details in requirements
   ’ Focus on business value and user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager using GitAI Teams, I need to know when all parallel subtasks assigned to child agents are complete, so that I can review the collective results and proceed with project finalization. The system should intelligently handle both successful and failed child tasks, providing clear visibility into what was accomplished and what needs attention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a parent agent has spawned 3 child agents to work on subtasks, **When** all 3 children post completion status comments (regardless of success/failure), **Then** the system automatically analyzes the results and provides actionable recommendations

2. **Given** 2 of 3 child agents report success with pull requests and 1 reports failure, **When** all have reported, **Then** the system intelligently determines whether to proceed with partial merging and documents the decision rationale

3. **Given** a child agent posts an ambiguous status like "mostly complete", **When** all children have reported, **Then** the system interprets the context and makes an appropriate decision about how to handle that child's work

4. **Given** all child agents successfully complete their tasks, **When** the last child reports completion, **Then** the system automatically initiates the merge process and creates a consolidated pull request

### Edge Cases
- What happens when more child agents report than were initially expected?
  ’ System proceeds with analysis and notes the discrepancy
- How does system handle edited or duplicate status comments?
  ’ System counts unique child identifiers and handles gracefully
- What happens if a child agent never reports status?
  ’ System has timeout mechanism or manual override option
- How does system handle merge conflicts between child pull requests?
  ’ System identifies conflicts and recommends resolution strategy

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when all expected child agents have reported their completion status via issue comments
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept child status reports in natural language format containing the marker "> Child"
- **FR-003**: System MUST trigger intelligent analysis once all children have reported, regardless of individual success/failure
- **FR-004**: System MUST interpret various status descriptions (success, failure, partial completion) from natural language comments
- **FR-005**: System MUST make context-aware decisions about whether to merge all, merge partial, or wait for manual intervention
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear summary of all child statuses and actions taken in a consolidated report
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where the actual number of reporting children differs from the expected count
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute approved merges automatically when conditions are met
- **FR-009**: System MUST create a final consolidation pull request when appropriate
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide transparency by documenting all decisions and reasoning in issue comments

### Key Entities
- **Issue**: Represents the parent task that spawns child agents, contains expected child count and tracks all status comments
- **Child Agent**: Autonomous worker that performs a subtask and reports status via standardized comment format
- **Status Comment**: Natural language report from child agent containing completion marker and status information
- **Pull Request**: Work output from successful child agents, subject to merging decisions
- **Completion Analysis**: Intelligent evaluation of all child statuses to determine appropriate next actions
