# Data Model: Child Agent Completion Tracking System

## Overview
Data structures and state transitions for the completion detection system. All data is ephemeral and derived from GitHub's API - no persistent storage.

## Core Entities

### 1. ParentIssue
Represents the GitHub issue that spawned child agents.

**Fields**:
- `issue_number`: Integer - GitHub issue number
- `issue_body`: String - Full issue body text
- `expected_child_count`: Integer - Extracted from issue body
- `created_at`: Timestamp - Issue creation time
- `author`: String - User who triggered the parent agent

**Validation Rules**:
- `issue_number` > 0
- `expected_child_count` >= 0 and <= 5 (max parallel children)

**State Transitions**:
```
CREATED â†’ CHILDREN_SPAWNED â†’ AWAITING_COMPLETIONS â†’ ANALYZING â†’ COMPLETE
```

### 2. ChildStatus
Represents a child agent's reported completion status.

**Fields**:
- `child_id`: String - Unique identifier (e.g., "C1", "C2")
- `comment_id`: Integer - GitHub comment ID
- `comment_body`: String - Full comment text
- `status_type`: Enum - SUCCESS | FAILURE | PARTIAL | AMBIGUOUS
- `pr_number`: Optional[Integer] - Associated PR if successful
- `failure_reason`: Optional[String] - Extracted failure description
- `timestamp`: Timestamp - When status was reported

**Validation Rules**:
- `comment_body` must contain "ðŸ¤– Child"
- `child_id` must match pattern `C\d+`
- If `status_type` == SUCCESS, `pr_number` should be present
- If `status_type` == FAILURE, `failure_reason` should be present

**Status Detection Logic**:
```python
def detect_status_type(comment_body):
    if "complete" in comment_body.lower() and "PR #" in comment_body:
        return "SUCCESS"
    elif "failed" in comment_body.lower() or "error" in comment_body.lower():
        return "FAILURE"
    elif "partial" in comment_body.lower() or "mostly" in comment_body.lower():
        return "PARTIAL"
    else:
        return "AMBIGUOUS"
```

### 3. CompletionAnalysis
Result of Claude's analysis of all child statuses.

**Fields**:
- `issue_number`: Integer - Parent issue reference
- `total_children`: Integer - Actual count of reporting children
- `successful_children`: List[String] - Child IDs that succeeded
- `failed_children`: List[String] - Child IDs that failed
- `partial_children`: List[String] - Child IDs with partial completion
- `merge_strategy`: Enum - MERGE_ALL | MERGE_PARTIAL | NO_MERGE | MANUAL_REVIEW
- `prs_to_merge`: List[Integer] - PR numbers to merge
- `reasoning`: String - Claude's explanation for decisions
- `final_pr_number`: Optional[Integer] - Consolidation PR if created

**Validation Rules**:
- `total_children` == len(successful + failed + partial)
- `prs_to_merge` subset of PRs from successful children
- `merge_strategy` must align with child statuses

**Strategy Decision Logic**:
```
IF all children successful:
    â†’ MERGE_ALL
ELIF > 50% successful AND no critical failures:
    â†’ MERGE_PARTIAL
ELIF any ambiguous status:
    â†’ MANUAL_REVIEW
ELSE:
    â†’ NO_MERGE
```

### 4. WorkflowEvent
Represents GitHub Actions workflow events for observability.

**Fields**:
- `event_type`: Enum - COMMENT_RECEIVED | COUNT_CHECK | ANALYSIS_TRIGGERED | ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
- `workflow_run_id`: Integer - GitHub Actions run ID
- `issue_number`: Integer - Associated issue
- `timestamp`: Timestamp - Event occurrence time
- `payload`: JSON - Event-specific data

**Event Flow**:
```
COMMENT_RECEIVED â†’ COUNT_CHECK â†’ [if threshold met] â†’ ANALYSIS_TRIGGERED â†’ ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
```

## Data Flow Sequences

    B --> C[Store in Workflow Context]
    C --> D[Count Unique IDs]
    D --> E{Count == Expected?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Trigger Analysis]
    E -->|No| G[Wait for More]
```

```

## GitHub API Data Structures

### Issue Comment (from GitHub API)
```json
{
  "id": 1234567890,
  "body": "ðŸ¤– Child C1 complete: PR #10 ready for review",
  "user": {
    "login": "github-actions[bot]",
    "type": "Bot"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/issues/42"
}
```

### Repository Dispatch Payload
```json
{
  "event_type": "analyze_completions",
  "client_payload": {
    "issue_number": 42,
    "expected_count": 3,
    "actual_count": 3,
    "comment_ids": [1234567890, 1234567891, 1234567892]
  }
}
```

### Claude Analysis Request
```json
{
  "issue_number": 42,
  "child_statuses": [
    {
      "child_id": "C1",
      "comment": "ðŸ¤– Child C1 complete: PR #10 ready for review"
    },
    {
      "child_id": "C2",
      "comment": "ðŸ¤– Child C2 failed: dependency conflicts"
    }
  ],
  "instruction": "Analyze these child agent reports and decide on merge strategy"
}
```

### Claude Analysis Response
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "merge_strategy": "MERGE_PARTIAL",
    "prs_to_merge": [10],
    "reasoning": "Child C1 completed successfully with PR #10. Child C2 failed due to dependency conflicts which don't affect C1's work. Recommending partial merge of C1's changes.",
    "summary": "1 of 2 children successful. Merging PR #10."
  }
}
```

## Relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ParentIssue ||--o{ ChildStatus : "spawns"
    ParentIssue ||--|| CompletionAnalysis : "triggers"
    ChildStatus }o--|| CompletionAnalysis : "analyzed in"
    CompletionAnalysis ||--o{ PR : "merges"
    WorkflowEvent }o--|| ParentIssue : "tracks"
```

## Constraints

### Concurrency
- Maximum 5 child agents per parent (constitution limit)
- Maximum 10 concurrent workflow runs (GitHub limit)

### Timing
- Child timeout: 8 minutes
- Analysis timeout: 8 minutes
- Total completion window: ~10 minutes

### Data Retention
- Comments: Permanent (GitHub stores)
- Workflow logs: 90 days (GitHub retention)
- Analysis results: Posted as issue comments (permanent)

## Error States

### Invalid States
1. **Count Overflow**: More children report than expected
   - Action: Proceed with analysis, note discrepancy

2. **Count Underflow**: Timeout waiting for all children
   - Action: Analyze available statuses after timeout

3. **Duplicate Reports**: Same child reports multiple times
   - Action: Use latest report only

4. **Invalid Markers**: Comment missing "ðŸ¤– Child" marker
   - Action: Ignore comment

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Idempotent Operations**: Re-running analysis produces same result
- **State Derivation**: Can reconstruct state from GitHub API at any time
- **Manual Override**: User can trigger analysis manually via command

## Performance Characteristics

### Data Volumes
- Comments per issue: 10-50 typical, 200 maximum
- Child agents per parent: 1-5
- Concurrent analyses: 1-3

### Processing Times
- Comment parsing: < 100ms
- Count checking: < 500ms
- Claude analysis: 30-60 seconds
- PR merging: 5-10 seconds each

### Memory Usage
- Workflow context: < 10MB
- Comment cache: < 1MB per issue
- Analysis result: < 100KB

## Stateless Verification
âœ… No database tables
âœ… No state files (STATE.json)
âœ… No persistent storage
âœ… All data from GitHub API
âœ… All state derivable from git history

This data model maintains the constitutional requirement of deriving all state from GitHub's API while providing the structure needed for intelligent completion tracking.
