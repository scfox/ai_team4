# Problem Statement for Spec Kit

## The Problem
We need a system that allows GitHub issue comments with `@gitaiteams` mentions to trigger AI agents that can work either individually or in parallel to complete tasks, with results automatically integrated and presented back to the user.

## Current Pain Points
- Single AI agent becomes a bottleneck for complex tasks
- No way to parallelize research or analysis
- Manual coordination of multiple AI responses

## Desired Solution
A GitHub Actions-based system that:
1. Responds to `@gitaiteams` mentions in issues
2. Automatically determines if tasks should be parallelized
3. Spawns child agents when beneficial (max 1 level deep)
4. Combines results automatically
5. Posts unified response to original issue

## Success Looks Like
- User posts: "@gitaiteams compare Framework A and Framework B"
- System spawns 2 agents to research in parallel
- Results are automatically combined into comparison table
- Complete response posted within 5 minutes

## Critical Constraints
- Must use GitHub Actions (no external services)
- No recursive agent spawning (children cannot have children)
- Python cannot perform git operations (GitHub Actions security model)
- Must be stateless (derive state from git/GitHub)
