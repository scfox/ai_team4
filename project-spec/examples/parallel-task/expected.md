# Expected Outcome

## Issue Comment Response
âœ… Framework comparison complete - 2 agents worked in parallel

## Combined Results

| Aspect | FastAPI | Flask |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Performance** | High (async/await native) | Moderate (WSGI-based) |
| **Type Safety** | Built-in (Pydantic) | Optional (extensions) |
| **API Documentation** | Automatic (OpenAPI) | Manual or extensions |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Easy |
| **Ecosystem** | Growing rapidly | Mature and extensive |
| **Use Case** | Modern APIs, microservices | Traditional web apps, APIs |
| **Async Support** | Native | Via extensions |
| **Database ORM** | SQLModel, Tortoise | SQLAlchemy |

### Child 1 Findings (FastAPI):
- Automatic API documentation with Swagger UI
- Built on Starlette and Pydantic
- Excellent for building modern REST APIs
- Native async/await support

### Child 2 Findings (Flask):
- Lightweight and flexible
- Extensive ecosystem of extensions
- Battle-tested in production
- Great for both simple and complex applications

## Recommendation
- Choose **FastAPI** for new API-first projects requiring high performance
- Choose **Flask** for traditional web applications or when ecosystem maturity matters

## Execution Details
- 2 children spawned in parallel
- Branch created: `gitaiteams/issue-43`
- Child branches: `gitaiteams/issue-43-child-1`, `gitaiteams/issue-43-child-2`
- Both children created PRs to parent branch
- Parent merged both PRs and created final PR to main
