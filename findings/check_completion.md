# Child Completion Tracking Analysis

## Problem Statement

In Test C execution, the parent orchestrator never detected when child agents completed their tasks and created PRs. This resulted in:
- Child PRs remaining unmerged
- No final PR created to main branch
- Status stuck at "processing" indefinitely
- No completion notification to the user

## Current State (ai_team4)

### What Works
1. Child agents successfully execute tasks
2. Child agents create PRs to parent branch
3. Status comment is created and updated during spawning

### What's Missing
1. **No PR event detection** - When children create PRs, nothing happens
2. **No completion checking** - No mechanism to check if all children are done
3. **No PR merging** - Child PRs are never merged into parent
4. **No finalization** - No final PR from parent branch to main
5. **No status completion** - Status comment never updated to "completed"

## How ai_team3 Solves This

### Event-Driven Architecture
1. **Label Router** (`label-router.yml`)
   - Detects when PRs are created to gitaiteams branches
   - Adds `trigger:child-pr` label
   - Dispatches `child-pr` event to orchestrator

2. **Orchestrator Handles Child PRs** (`ai-task-orchestrator.yml`)
   - Has separate handler for `child-pr` trigger
   - Merges the child PR into parent branch
   - Checks if all children complete using `check_completion.sh`
   - Creates final PR to main when all done
   - Updates status comment to completed

3. **Completion Checker** (`check_completion.sh`)
   - Examines all child branches for a parent
   - Checks PR states (MERGED, OPEN, CLOSED, or no PR)
   - Returns structured JSON with counts
   - Exit codes indicate completion status:
     - 0: All complete
     - 1: Still running
     - 2: Partial failure
     - 3: No children

### Workflow Flow
```
Child completes task
    ↓
Creates PR to parent branch
    ↓
Label router detects PR creation
    ↓
Dispatches child-pr event
    ↓
Orchestrator receives event
    ↓
Merges child PR
    ↓
Checks completion status
    ↓
If all complete:
  - Creates PR to main
  - Updates status to completed
```

## Implementation Plan for ai_team4

### 1. Create check_completion.sh script
- Check all child branches for a parent
- Query PR states using gh CLI
- Return JSON with completion details
- Proper exit codes

### 2. Add PR detection workflow
Two options:
- **Option A**: Separate workflow triggered by PR events
- **Option B**: Add to existing router workflow

Recommendation: Option A - cleaner separation of concerns

### 3. Update orchestrator to handle child PRs
- Add handler for child-pr events
- Merge child PRs
- Check completion
- Create final PR when done
- Update status

### 4. Update child executor
- Ensure PRs are created with proper base branch
- Add metadata to PR body if needed

## Key Differences from ai_team3

### Simpler Approach Possible
- We don't need the complex label routing system
- Can trigger directly on PR events
- Simpler state management

### What to Keep
- check_completion.sh logic
- PR merging flow
- Status update on completion

## Risk Mitigation

### Race Conditions
- Multiple children creating PRs simultaneously
- Use concurrency groups to serialize PR handling

### Error Handling
- Child PR fails to merge (conflicts)
- Partial completion scenarios
- Need clear error reporting

### Testing Strategy
1. Test with single child completion
2. Test with multiple children completing
3. Test partial failure scenarios
4. Test conflict resolution

## Next Steps

1. Create `check_completion.sh` script
2. Create `pr-handler.yml` workflow for PR events
3. Update orchestrator with completion logic
4. Test with new issue demonstrating parallel tasks
