# Node.js Web Serving Platform Evaluation

## Executive Summary
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, designed for building scalable network applications. It has become one of the most popular platforms for web serving, particularly for real-time applications, microservices, and API backends.

## Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Non-blocking I/O model provides excellent performance for I/O-intensive operations
- **Single-Threaded Event Loop**: Efficient handling of concurrent connections without thread overhead
- **V8 Engine**: JIT compilation and continuous optimization delivers near-native performance for JavaScript
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory footprint compared to traditional thread-per-request models
- **Response Times**: Excellent for real-time applications with typical response times in milliseconds

### Benchmarks
- Can handle 10,000+ concurrent connections on modest hardware
- HTTP request throughput: 20,000-50,000 requests/second (depending on payload and complexity)
- WebSocket connections: Can maintain 100,000+ persistent connections on a single server
- Startup time: Fast cold starts (100-500ms typical)

### Limitations
- CPU-intensive operations can block the event loop
- Single-threaded nature means vertical scaling has limits
- Not optimal for heavy computational tasks without worker threads
