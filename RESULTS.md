# Child Agent 2 Results

## Task
Evaluate Node.js as a web serving platform. Analyze performance, scalability, ecosystem, deployment options, security features, and provide detailed recommendations for use cases.

## Results

### 1. Performance Analysis

#### Strengths
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop model that excels at handling concurrent connections with low memory overhead
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Asynchronous operations prevent thread blocking, enabling efficient handling of thousands of simultaneous connections

#### Performance Metrics
- Can handle 10,000+ concurrent connections on modest hardware
- Response times typically under 50ms for API endpoints
- Memory footprint: ~20-30MB base, scales efficiently with load
- CPU utilization: Optimal for I/O-heavy workloads, less ideal for CPU-intensive tasks
