### Verdict
Node.js is an excellent choice for modern web applications, particularly those requiring real-time features, microservices, or API development. Its event-driven architecture makes it ideal for I/O-intensive applications, while its vast ecosystem accelerates development. However, it's not suitable for CPU-intensive workloads or applications requiring complex multi-threading. Organizations should consider Node.js when developer productivity, time-to-market, and scalability for concurrent connections are priorities.

### Recommendation Score: 8.5/10
**Best for**: APIs, real-time apps, microservices, serverless functions
**Avoid for**: Heavy computation, large-scale data processing, traditional enterprise applications requiring extensive multi-threading
